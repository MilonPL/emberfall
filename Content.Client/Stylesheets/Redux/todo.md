- [x] Inventory \[X] button looks weird
    - Styles for `TextureButton` were not implemented
- [ ] \[X] button is misaligned on FancyWindow also title text too kinda
- [ ] Right click menu has no colors
- [ ] autolathe and protolathe open to the left (also make them Fancy)
- [ ] Guidebook button broken
- [ ] Admin Message window exit button
- [ ] Action menu broken
- [ ] Text when editing paper is white
- [ ] Stamps look weird?
- [ ] `ScrollContainer` has no scrollbar!!!

Weird:
- [ ] `NavMapControl.cs:133` why

Maybe:

- [ ] Create a HUD sheet for examine, right click, chat etc. perhaps, distinguish from NT Ui
  - (remove `ContextMenuSheetlet.cs:16`)
