Emberfall is a lore-rich fork that reimagines the [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/) experience, bringing players to the Aelys systemâ€”a battleground of corporate ambition and survival. As part of the crew of a Solus Concord orbital station, you'll tackle challenges ranging from station upkeep to Aeonite extraction.
