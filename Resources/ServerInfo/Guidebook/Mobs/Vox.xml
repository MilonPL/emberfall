  [color=#ffa500]Caution! This species has a severely limiting game mechanic and is not recommended for new players. [/color]

  They breathe nitrogen, and [color=#ffa500] oxygen is very toxic to them.[/color]
  They need to be on internals at all times to avoid being poisoned by the station's oxygen.
  They can eat raw meat without any ill effects, although eating or drinking will probably require you to remove your breath mask.

  Their unarmed claw attacks deal Slash damage instead of Blunt.
