# A.P.E.

The Anomalous Particle Emitter is a machine used to interface with anomalies. It is the primary way of manipulating the stats of an anomaly.

The A.P.E. can shoot three different kinds of anomalous particles: Delta, Epsilon, Sigma and Zeta. Each particle type has certain effects:

- [color=crimson]Danger:[/color] Increases the severity of an anomaly.
- [color=plum]Unstable:[/color] Increases the instability of an anomaly.
- [color=goldenrod]Containment:[/color] Increases the stability at the cost of health.
- [color=#6b75fa]Transformation:[/color] Increases the severity and has changed to change behavior.

Which particle type corresponds to each effect is unique and can be learned by scanning the anomaly.

The A.P.E. can also be locked by anyone with science access, which prevents it from being deconstructed, turned on or off, or having the particle type switched.
