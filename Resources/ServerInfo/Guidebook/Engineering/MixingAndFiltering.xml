  # Mixing and Filtering
  Gas mixers and filters are essential tools for manipulating the composition of gases within a pipe network.

  Gas mixers and filters require power from a nearby LV cable to operate.

  ## Gas Mixer
  Gas mixers are used to combine gases in specific ratios within a pipe network. They are essential for creating controlled gas mixtures for various applications.

  Gas mixers have 3 connections: 2 inputs and 1 output, as shown below:

  </Box>

</Box>

  Gas mixers will still respect the requested gas mixture even if one of the input gases is not available. For example:
  - If the requested mixture is 22% oxygen and 78% nitrogen, but there is no available oxygen, the mixer will not work until oxygen is available.
  - If oxygen is available, but at a pressure lower than required to create the proper mixture at the requested pressure, the mixer will create the mixture, but the output will be lower pressure than requested.

  Gas mixers can be used in a variety of applications, for example:
  - Mixing oxygen and nitrogen to create a breathable atmosphere
  - Mixing oxygen and plasma for plasma burning to create Tritium

  ## Gas Filter
  Gas filters are used to separate gases from a mixture within a pipe network.

  </Box>

  Gas filters will become blocked and will not filter gas if either output is blocked.

  Gas filters can be used in a variety of applications, for example:
  - Filtering out unwanted gases from a pipe network
  - Separating specific gases for storage in a station's recyclernet
