  With these devices, Atmos can insert, extract, or scrub unwanted gasses from any atmosphere they would like.
  This allows the maintaining of a safe, breathable atmosphere.

  All of these devices require power through a nearby LV cable to function. All except for the air injector can also be linked to an Air Alarm using a multitool.

  Linking compatible devices to an air alarm unlocks more configuration options and functionality. Otherwise, these devices follow their default behavior as defined in the subguides.
