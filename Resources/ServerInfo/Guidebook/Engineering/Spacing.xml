  # Spacing
  Spacing is the most common form of atmospheric upset that can occur on the station.

  While the damage that caused the spacing is often time-consuming to fix, the actual spacing problem can be quickly resolved by simply repressurizing the area.

  Fixing spacing generally follows two simple steps:

  1. Identify the area that has been spaced, and seal the hole.

  - If you're having trouble finding the hole, you can carefully listen for the flow of air rushing by you, if air is currently leaking to space.
  - Look for any holes underneath girders that may be hard to see.

  2. Repressurize the area.

  - Air vents enter pressure lockout when a room is spaced, so you'll need to override the vents to repressurize the area. You can do this by setting the connected air alarm to fill, or by using a screwdriver on a vent to manually override it temporarily.

  ## Things to Avoid
  - Keep in mind that while you have an infinite supply of mined gas, it is not quick enough to fill up multiple rooms at once. Setting air alarms to fill first [italic]before[/italic] fixing the root problem will often lead to wasted time and gas.

  - Leaving air alarms on the Fill mode unsupervised may lead to overpressuring a room, which can potentially harm crew if it gets out of hand.
