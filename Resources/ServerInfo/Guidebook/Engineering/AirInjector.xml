  #Air Injector
  The air injector is a special vent that forces gasses into the atmosphere it's exposed to.

  It is primarily used to force gasses into high-pressure rooms like the station's [textlink="gas storage rooms" link="GasMiningAndStorage"], or a burn chamber.

  The air injector does not require [textlink="power" link="Power"] to function.

  The air injector will inject gasses into the atmosphere it's exposed to until the atmosphere reaches 9000 kPa.

  The air injector's speed is proportional to the amount of gas in the injector.
  The more gas in the injector, the faster it will inject gas into the exposed atmosphere.

  A normal air injector (even one that has no gasses to inject) will have a [color=green]green[/color] light.
  An air injector that cannot inject gasses into the atmosphere will have a [color=red]red[/color] light.
