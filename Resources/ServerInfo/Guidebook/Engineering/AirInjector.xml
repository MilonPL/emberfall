  #Air Injector
  The air injector is a special vent that forces gasses into the atmosphere it's exposed to.

  It is primarily used to force gasses into high-pressure rooms like the station's gas storage rooms, or a burn chamber.
  The air injector does not require power to function.

  The air injector will inject gasses into the atmosphere it's exposed to until the atmosphere reaches 9000 kPa.

  A normal air injector (even one that has no gasses to inject) will have a [color=green]green[/color] light. An air injector that cannot inject gasses into the atmosphere will have a [color=red]red[/color] light.
