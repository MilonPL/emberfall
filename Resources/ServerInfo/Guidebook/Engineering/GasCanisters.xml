  Gas canisters are a way to store gas in a portable container for easy transport. They can store 1000 liters of gas.

  They can be filled with gas from a pipe network, and then dragged around to be used in various machines or pipenets.

  Gas canisters can be completely filled and emptied using a gas pump, or by connecting them to a pipenet using a connector.
  If a pump is not present, gas will be free to move in and out of the canister to balance pressure, temperature, and composition.

  You can connect handheld tanks to a gas canister to refill them using the release valve on the canister. The release valve also has a adjustable pressure regulator to control the pressure of the handheld tank connected.

  Opening the release valve on a canister with no handheld tank connected will release gas into the atmosphere, at the specified regulator pressure. Be sure to close the release valve before you eject your handheld tank!

  Gas canisters can be used to store a variety of gases, including oxygen, nitrogen, and plasma. Gas canisters can be used in a variety of applications, for example:
  - Supplying gas to a welding tool or other portable gas-powered equipment
  - Storing emergency oxygen supplies in case of a hull breach or other atmospheric emergency
  - Transporting gas between different parts of the station
