  # Voltage Networks
  In Space Station 14, power distribution is divided into three separate voltage networks.
  These networks are the Low Voltage Network, the Medium Voltage Network, and the High Voltage Network.

  These networks power different types of machinery on the station.

  ## Low Voltage Network
  The Low Voltage Network is used for powering almost all small machines on the station. This includes things like lights, computers, and other small devices.

  Low Voltage power is provided by APCs, which are wall-mounted devices that convert power from the Medium Voltage Network to Low Voltage.

  Low Voltage wire doesn't have to be directly run to every machine, as it can power multiple machines as long as the wire is close enough to the machine.

  ## Medium Voltage Network
  The Medium Voltage Network is used for powering APCs and other power-hungry machinery that can only accept Medium Voltage power.
  The Particle Accelerator is an example, as it operates on Medium Voltage power.

  Medium Voltage power is provided by Substations, which are large machines that convert power from the High Voltage Network to Medium Voltage.

  There are also wallmount variants of these substations for compact spaces, like shuttles.

  ## High Voltage Network
  The High Voltage Network is used for moving large amount of power across the station. It is used to power most power handling equipment, such as SMES units and Substations.

  Most high-output generators output power to the High Voltage Network.

  ## Shock Damage
  If you are shocked by a cable carrying power, you will take damage. The amount of damage you take is based on the voltage of the cable that shocked you.

  Low voltage cables will deal less damage than medium voltage cables, which will deal less damage than high voltage cables.

  Energized high voltage and medium voltage cabling hurts, so be sure to wear insulated gloves when working with it.
