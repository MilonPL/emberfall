# Pipes and Pumps
Pipes and pumps are the primary method of moving gasses between rooms, containers, and machines. As an example, they are used to distribute breathable air to rooms through the station's distribution net or Distro.

## Pipes
Pipes are used to distribute and move gasses from one place to another. There are a wide variety of pipes available to construct:

Pipes will [color=#a4885c]automatically[/color] connect to other pipes when wrenched (or bolted) to the hull to form a network of pipes. A network of pipes is commonly called a [color=#a4885c]pipenet[/color].

However, pipes will [color=#ff0000]not connect[/color] to pipes on top of each other. For example, building a bent pipe on top of a straight pipe to form a makeshift T-junction will not work.

Without pumps, gasses flow through pipes in both directions to balance their respective pressure, volume, and temperature.
For example, inducing a vacuum or high pressure in a pipe will cause gas to move throughout the pipenet to balance pressure.

## Pumps
Pumps are the primary way of actively moving gasses through a pipenet. They take gas from one side, and push it to the other.
There are two different types of pumps:
