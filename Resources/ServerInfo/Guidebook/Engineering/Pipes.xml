  # Pipes
  Pipes are used to distribute gasses from one place to another.
  There are a wide variety of pipes available to construct:

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPipeHalf" Caption="half"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPipeBend" Caption="bend"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPipeTJunction" Caption="T junction"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPipeFourway" Caption="fourway"/>
  </Box>

  Pipes will [color=#a4885c]automatically connect[/color] to other pipes when anchored (or wrenched) to the hull to form a [textlink="network of pipes." link="PipeNetworks"]
  A network of pipes is commonly called a [textlink="pipenet" link="PipeNetworks"].

  However, pipes will [color=red]not connect[/color] to pipes on top of each other.
  For example, building a bent pipe on top of a straight pipe to form a makeshift T-junction will not work.

  You can color pipes (and most equipment that handles gasses) using a spray painter.
  This is commonly done to distinguish the air and waste components of the station's Distro pipenet.
