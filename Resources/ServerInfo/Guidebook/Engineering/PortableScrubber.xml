  # Portable Scrubber
  The portable scrubber is a portable machine that can be used to scrub the atmosphere in a room.

  It is very useful for quickly scrubbing unwanted gasses from a room when regular scrubbers are working too slow, or when a scrubber is not present.

  The portable scrubber requires power through a nearby LV cable to operate.

  The portable scrubber automatically starts scrubbing all non-breathable gasses from the room when it is bolted (wrenched) to the floor.

  It will stop scrubbing when unbolted (unwrenched) from the floor, or when its internal volume is full. The scrubber has an internal capacity of 1250 litres.

  ## Dumping Waste and Storage
  The scrubber's internal volume can be emptied by bolting (wrenching it) onto a connector.

  Stations commonly have a dedicated emptying point to quickly transfer the waste from the scrubber to the station's wastenet.
