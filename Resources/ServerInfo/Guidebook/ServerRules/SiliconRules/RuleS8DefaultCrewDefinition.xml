  # Silicon Rule 8 - Your HUD determines who is crew
  Unless a law redefines the definition of crew, then anyone who the HUD indicates to you has a job, including passengers, is a crewmember. You cannot do something that causes someone to not be considered crew, but you can allow someone else to do something that causes someone to not be crew.
  
  The following icons are not considered crew:
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="NoIdIcon" Caption="No ID"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="UnknownIcon" Caption="Unknown"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="VisitorIcon" Caption="Visitor"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="BorgIcon" Caption="Cyborg"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="StationAiIcon" Caption="Station AI"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SyndicateIcon" Caption="Syndicate"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ZombieIcon" Caption="Zombie"/>
  </Box>
